# Technical Paper: Learning Process

## 1. How to Learn Faster with the Feynman Technique.

### 1.1 What is the Feynman Technique? 

**There are mainly four techniques**
- First Write down the name of the topic you want to explain it.
- Try to explain the topic or concept in simple language as much as you can.
- Identify the area you struggled with while explaining.
- Now look at the complicated words and try to break them into more understandable ones.

### 1.2 What are the different ways to implement this technique in your learning process?
- **Teaching Others**: It is better to test yourself whether you have understood the concept or not.
- **Problem Solving**: Breaking problems into chunks and applying the Feynman technique could be one of the ways.
- **Creating Educational Content**: We can create blogs, Youtube channels, and Posts, and explain different topics.
- **Conceptual Learning**: When learning a new concept Feynman technique could be applied as i.e simply write down
  and break into pieces and try to keep it simple as much as possible.

## 2. Learning How to Learn TED talk by Barbara Oakley

- Barbara Oakley, a professor of engineering share her life journey and how she starts learning when she was not
  having enough money to go to college.
- To learn a language she joined the military and at age 26 she left it after completion then she start learning
  calculus like maths language as she thought languages are important but maths and science are also too important.
- She explains two modes of brain **focus mode** and **difuse mode**.
- Focus mode is like a pinball moving along known pathways, while the diffusion mode allows for creative thinking and
  new ideas, and by alternating b/w these nodes, one can enhance learning.
- Using Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison as examples, how to use these modes.
- She also suggested 25 minutes of focused work and then having a short break.
- She encourages students of slow learners and weak memory learners.
- She focused on effective learning techniques as one can focus on **including exercise**, **testing oneself**,
  **homework practice**, **recalling information** rather than just reading.
  
### 2.1 What are some of the steps that you can take to improve your learning process?

- **Understanding Learning style**: My study should suit my learning style.
- **Set clear goals**: To stay focused and motivated I should define short-term goals.
- **Active learning**: Doing Homework practice, testing myself, practicing, and recalling information rather than
   just reading
- **Staying Calm Down**: While going stuck I can use methods of switching between diffusion and focus modes of my
  brain.

## 3. Learn Anything in 20 hours.

- Gustavo Rocha, shares his journey as a new parent.
- He explains the 10000-hour rule to become an expert in any field.
- But according to Gustavo, it takes 20 hrs approx to master any field but it should be in quality of time spent.
   
### 3.1 What are some of the steps that you can while approaching a new topic?

- **Deconstruct the skill**: Break down the field into chunks and first focus on the most important part of it.
- **Learn Enough to Self-Correct**: Use the required resources to learn the basics, but I should not get in stuck in excessive preparation. I should practice a way to improve self-correct.
- **Removing Barriers to Practice**: Try to minimize distractions like Whatsapp, Instagram notifications.
- **Practice for at least 20 hours**: Definitely it should be quality of time i.e 20 hours.
